# Beat-Sharer

Ability to share songs lists with others.

# Usage

1. Download executable in releases.
2. Place executable in your "Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels/" folder.
3. Run executable.

## To Download

3. Type 'y' for download option
4. Type in a code to begin the download for a song list.
5. (Optional) If you do not have any songs in the same folder as your executable (refer to step 2) you will be asked to verify the folder. WARNING: Typing 'y' here will download all the songs to the current folder. Please be sure this is where you want them.

## To Upload

3. Type 'y' for upload option
4. Remember the code it gives back to you. This is used to share or redownload your song list.

### Notes

* There are a limited number of UIDs so your songs will be avaible until someone ends up generating the same UID. This should take quite a while until userbase grows.
* The downloader will skip already downloaded songs if finds in the current folder (Typically "Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels/")
